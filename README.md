I developed a chatbot capable of performing real-time currency conversion between any two global currencies, along with handling basic conversational (small talk) interactions.
<br>
The application is built using Flask as the backend framework, with Dialogflow managing intent detection and conversational flow. A third-party currency exchange rate API is integrated to fetch live conversion data. These components are connected via Dialogflow webhooks, allowing the Flask server to dynamically process user requests and generate appropriate responses.
